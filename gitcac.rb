      <<-EOS.undent
        This script attempts to modify /etc/paths.

        If this is a new install, your current $PATH might not check /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin.
        Close and reopen this terminal or say 'exec bash -l' to get a fresh environment.
        If that does not work, check /etc/paths and ensure /usr/local/bin is the first entry.
